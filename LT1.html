            <h3> PEMDAS </h3>
            <p> Algebraic Expressions are mathematical operations that involve variables. With our summary that takes a 3 minute read, you'll be as smart as Albert Einstein and Nikola Tesla's braincells combined. ((42-7&radic;12-11 + 11^2)/(16-13)^2)^0 + 2. First we need to know of PEMDAS ( Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication & Division, Addition and Subtraction ). PEMDAS is a mathematical rule found in Algebra and controls how equation is solved. The order goes by the following, Parenthesis first, Then Exponents, Afterwards Multiplication and Division, Finally Addition and Subtraction. So with this in your brain, let's try this problem! 7 + 2 * 5 + 4. First we multiply 2 * 5 since it's higher up in the PEMDAS Hierachy. So now the problem is 7 + 10 + 4. Then find the sum being 21. Now try this yourself : 2 * 5 + 6 / 5. You should've gotten 10 and 6/5. If so then congrats! Let's move on.  </p>

            <h3> Exponents In Detail </h3>
            <p> Exponents are like multiplication but multiply/divide a number by itself a certain amount of times. Here's how they workd. You've probably heard things like 2 squared or 3 cubed and those words actually mean something. Squared means to the second power and cubed is to the third power. Positive exponents multiply a number by itself a certain amount of times. You would multiply the number the amount of the times the exponent is large for example, 2 to the third power is 2 * 2 * 2. You multiply it three times like the exponent would hint you to. Negative exponents flip a number for example. 3 can also be 3/1 and if it was something like 3 to the negative third power, you'd turn 3/1 into 1/3 and vice versa if the base number was a fraction to begin with. Then you'd multiple each numerator by another numerator and denominator by denominator FOR EXAMPLE , 3 to the negative third power is jjust 1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3. Every 1 multiplied by itself is still 1 and every number in the denominator being 3 in this case multiplied altogether is 27 so 3 to the negative third power is one over 27 or 1/27. And one final but important detail is anything to the 0th power is 1, yep 1! (7*8+9-7/3+3) to the zeroth power is one! Another useful thing to know is when you divide a variable by a variable and both have the same variable but different exponents, the problem x^a / x^b becomes x^(a-b) because it's basically saying x times itself a times divided by x times itself b times. </p>

            <h3> Variables </h3>
            <p> Variables are found commonly in Algebra and get people thinking who invited English into the field of 1 + 1 but it's really easy to learn how they work. Variables can be undefined or sometimes have you solve for their value. For example x + 3 = 5 and 5 - 3 is 2 and if 2 is required to make 5 with 3 then x = 2. Variables like x, y, and z have their own "characteristics" for example! When you pair a number to the left of a variable (3x), you would be refering to triple the value of x. That number is called a coefficient. Exponents also apply to x like x to the second power being x * x or x(x). Also fun fact, coefficients can apply to parenthesis so for example, 3(2) is six because you're multiplying 3 with 2 like you would with a variable so 3(5 + 10) is 45 because 3 * 15 is 45.  </p>

        <section id="LT1DistributiveProperty">
            <h3> Distributive Property </h3>
            <p> Distributive Property is very common in Algebra for solving things like turning parenthesis into something simpler. The Distributive Property multiplies each number in the parenthesis by the coefficient outside FOR EXAMPLE : 3(2+5) = 6 + 15 and this can also apply to variables : 5(x-5) = 5x - 25. It turns 4(10-y) + 6(x+8) into 88 + 6x - 4y</p>

        <section id="LT1LikeTerms">
            <h3> Like Terms : </h3>
            <p> Like Terms are terms that are compatible. In another way, you can add them together because they share the same variables and exponents, coefficients don't count. An example of like terms is 4x^2 + 5y^2 + 2x^2 + 3x^3. The like terms in the problem are 4x^2 and 2x^2 because they share the same variable and exponents. 5y^2 isn't a like term alongside the other two because the variable is different and 3x^3 isn't a like term because it differs in exponents. With this known, you can shorten the longest of problems into the smallest of them.</p>

            <h3> GCF and LCM </h3>
            <p> The GCF and LCM are mathematical "functions" that find the greatest shared factor/ least shared multiple of 2 or more numbers. The GCF is easily found by using Prime Factorization. If unfamiliar with it, You basically take the prime factors of certain numbers and they often come with exponents FOR EXAMPLE, the Prime factorization of 20 is 5 * 2^2 because the numbers are as prime as they can be and multiply to be 20. With this in mind, finding the GCF is through first getting the prime factorization of all numbers and then multiplying each shared prime factor FOR EXAMPLE : gcf(15,10) is already 10 but watch the process, 15 => 5 * 3 10 => 5 * 2, 5 is found in both prime factorizations and since it's the only shared prime factor, it would be your answer in this case. Finding the LCM also involves prime factorization except you multiply every prime factor from every number but one catch, no multiplying duplicates for example : the lcm of 15 and 10 is 30 because 10 => 5 * 2 and 15 => 5 * 3, we multiply 5 * 3 * 2, not 5 * 5 * 3 * 2! </p>
